# High-Frequency-Amplifier
During our 3rd semester at the University of Moratuwa, we designed a High-Frequency Amplifier. Croos, Tharusha, Sasini, and Kumudu, who contribute to our team, were able to use their knowledge in circuit design, PCB design, and enclosure design to produce this device resulting in an amplifier capable of driving an 8-ohm load (speaker) without introducing any distortion to the output signal. It can amplify signals ranging from 20kHz to 100kHz, employing a two-stage amplifier approach with specific configurations.

## Objective ##
The primary objective of this project is to design a high-frequency amplifier with the following specifications:
- **Load Compatibility:** Capable of driving an 8-ohm load (speaker) without causing distortion in the output signal.
- **Frequency Range:** Amplify signals within the frequency range of 20kHz to 100kHz.
- **Amplification Stages:** Utilize a two-stage amplifier approach. The first stage employs a transistor in the common emitter configuration, while the second stage uses an AB Push-Pull 
  amplifier configuration to achieve the necessary power amplification.

## Components ##
- BC547BG NPN BJT transistor
- TIP31C and TIP32C power transistors
- Capacitors, Resistors, Power resistors
- PCB
- Enclosure

## Circuit Design ##
Our circuit was design using **Multism**. It incorporates two amplifier stages. The first stage utilizes a transistor in the common emitter configuration, while the second stage employs an AB Push-Pull amplifier configuration. This combination ensures efficient high-frequency signal amplification.

## PCB Design ##
The PCB design we designed using **Altium Software**. It is essential for achieving reliable and precise circuit connections. It minimizes interference and supports efficient signal amplification. The "PCB design files" directory contains the PCB design files, which include:
- Schematic Design
- PCB Design
- Gerber files for manufacturing
